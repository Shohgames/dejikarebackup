Upon my research on the possibility of spraypaint wihtout any problems i did qutie a lot of stuff in and out.
first i looked online of hte simmilair tyoe of people that could be doing simimlair stuff, and it turns out that there are some people like that.
second, it is going ot be not only difficult to have a propeor big time space from a privately owned land to do such events without getting a holding company that will be able to absorb the burecratic problems and etc.
thirdly, a lot of street artists seem to do it without permission and just get away with it, but there are instances that police might get involved.
so as log as we can avoid these problems, this can be done on a semi legal way. i could not find a way to verify this, but as long as the income from this is minimal, meaning like less that 100000 yen overall, this should not be a bothersome problem for the tax agency, so as long as the income from the sales will be low, it will not raise much suspicision.
but the police might indeed ask for permits and the right to sell, and they can basically block everything overnight,

upon my research, i found out that shibuya statin, umeda station, and others are quite good for such events, https://spraymantv.com/ask/2018/08/31/police/
